            <p class="short-description">Created and optimized a predictive model to forecast Twitch user engagement...</p>
            <div class="project-details">
                <p>I led the creation of a machine learning model that predicted Twitch user engagement using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Random Forest Regression. Through data analysis, we identified key engagement metrics, such as watch time and session durations, which improved our predictions. I facilitated the project, ensuring the team developed simple and complex models while maintaining data integrity. The final model achieved an MAE of 2.08, the best performance among several evaluated models. <br><br><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4DUmcN2DbwVXbQyaCqE7H23vY3wZMgRU9jEQPFR7Zw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click Here for Training Report</a></b></p>
