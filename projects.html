            <div class="project-details">
                <p>I created a low-poly, third-person shooter, survival game. In the past, I was interested in the concept of game design and being an indie game developer, which led me to trying out making this game! <br> Throughout this journey I discovered the importance of various game features such as sound design, story plot development, and environment building. At the moment, I am currently using Unity's Unreal Engine to compose the game, Blender to develop game models, and Audacity to process audio and sound effects to be used by various models in my project. <br> <br><b>Link to closed source project coming soon!</b></p>

            <h2>PC Full Restoration</h2>
            <p> [06/2022 - 06/2024] </p>
            <p class="short-description">A journey of diagnosing and repairing a broken PC...</p>
            <div class="project-details">
                <p>2 years ago, I was gifted a broken PC with problem after problem of a mix between software and hardware faults. Over the course of 2 years, I learned how to diagnose broken PC parts, navigate the BIOS, and use the cmd to repair outdated and broken Windows software. Lastly, the original wiring of the PC was very rushed and put together in a way that could further damage the PC long-term, so as the final step of the PC restoration, I rewired all the main components/wires to complete the build and make the PC look well-built and practically brand new.</p>

            <p> [06/2022 - 08/2022] </p>
            <p class="short-description">The creation of UI features to be used in the hit game, VALORANT...</p>
            <div class="project-details">
                <p>During the Summer of 2022, I contributed to the creation of UI features to be used in the game, VALORANT. This was a remote opportunity for me to work with the quality assurance engineering team and learn about the importance of design and UI interaction in the environment of a game that's fast-paced and reliant on readable UI features. During this timeframe, I utilized Discord, Microsoft Teams, and Github to contribute to the readability and quality assurance of the interactive frames to be used in the game's home page. </b></p>
