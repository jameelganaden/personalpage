            <h2>PC Restoration</h2>
            <p> 2 years ago, I was gifted a broken PC with problem after problem of a mix between software 
                and hardware faults. Over the course of 2 years, I learned how to diagnose broken PC parts, 
                navigate the BIOS, and use the cmd to repair outdated and broken Windows software. Lastly, the 
                original wiring of the PC was very rushed and put together in a way that could further damage 
                the PC long-term, so as the final step of the PC restoration, I rewired all the main components/wires 
                to complete the build and make the PC look well-built and practically brand new.</p>

            <h2>Return of the Undead</h2>
            <p> This project is my take on a low-poly, third-person shooter, survival game. I took on this fun project 
                as I was very interested in the concept of game design and being an indie game developer. Throughout 
                this journey I discovered the importance of various game features such as sound design, story plot development, 
                and environment building. At the moment, I am currently using Unity's Unreal Engine to develop the game, Blender
                to build game models, and Audacity to process audio and sound effects to be used by various models in my project.
