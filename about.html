  I am a second year studying computer science at University of California, San Diego. 
  Originally, I enjoyed aspects of computer engineering through the various PC builds that I've put together in the past,
  along with constant research on the most up-to-date computer components. As life progressed, I discovered computer science 
  which may not be an easy major, but I certainly find it interesting to problem solve and develop solutions. I am currently enjoying learning about different
  elements of computer science, and I hope to continue developing my experience in various projects.

<br>

  This website serves as a showcase for all the projects and experience that I've developed throughout the years. <br>
